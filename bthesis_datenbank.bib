By deposition of potassium on the surface, the workfunction has been varied. Thus it has been possible to investigate the band structure of gold near the L point. Several interband energies have been determined and the symmetry character of the bands near Ef has been unambiguously assessed. Thermal effects have been investigated by cooling the sample well below the Debye temperature: they have been found to be irrelevant. The particular applicability of group theoretical arguments to this photoemission technique is shown.},

	abstract = {With advances in spatial resolution reaching the atomic scale, two-dimensional (2D) and 3D imaging in electron microscopy has become an essential methodology in various fields of study. Here, we report 4D imaging, with in situ spatiotemporal resolutions, in ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM). The ability to capture selected-area-image dynamics with pixel resolution and to control the time separation between pulses for temporal cooling of the specimen made possible studies of fleeting structures and morphologies. We demonstrate the potential for applications with two examples, gold and graphite. For gold, after thermally induced stress, we determined the atomic structural expansion, the nonthermal lattice temperature, and the ultrafast transients of warping/bulging. In contrast, in graphite, striking coherent transients of the structure were observed in both image and diffraction, directly measuring, on the nanoscale, the longitudinal resonance period governed by Young's elastic modulus. The success of these studies demonstrates the promise of UEM in real-space imaging of dynamics.
Imaging with single electrons can track structural dynamics of gold and graphite in real space with femtosecond temporal resolution and angstrom spatial resolution.

Motivated by recent developments in ultrafast electron diffraction and imaging techniques{,} we present here a comprehensive account of the fundamental processes involved in electron pulse propagation{,} and make comparisons with experimental results. The electron pulse{,} as an ensemble of charged particles{,} travels under the influence of the space-charge effect and the spread of the momenta among its electrons. The shape and size{,} as well as the trajectories of the individual electrons{,} may be altered. The resulting implications on the spatiotemporal resolution capabilities are discussed both for the N-electron pulse and for single-electron coherent packets introduced for microscopy without space-charge.},
